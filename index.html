          <p>The Roman Empire was one of the most powerful economic, military, political, and cultural forces in the world at its time.  It was one of the largest empires in world history, and was the largest empire during its time (known as the classical antiquity period).</p>

            <p>At its height, it ruled 70 million people—equal to 21 percent of the world's population at that time—and covered over five million square kilometers. Later, Roman and Greek culture were spread by European expansion on a worldwide scale—leading to both playing a significant role in the rest of the world's development.</p>

            <p>Learning about the Roman Empire is essential to learning about the foundations of Western culture. Read about the Roman Empire <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire">here.</a></p>
